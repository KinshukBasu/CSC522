Background
There are many research about predicting the popularity of online content, but it is still difficult to predict the future. Szabo, G. et al did this kind of research for two popular portals Digg and YouTube. And they made a model to be used to predict the future popolarity by using the linear correlation between popularity at early and later times. They found out that measuring access to a post during the first two hours can allow to forecast its 30 days popularity with about 10% error. And YouTube needs 10 days to achieve a similar prediction of error. As this comparison, there can be many factors affecting the popularity of online content. And it can differ among different web sites.
This research can be useful for business fields like an advertisement. Advertisers can try and get their advertisements on pages which are predicted to be more popular, or content developers can adjust their rates for advertisements based on the predicted popularity.

Introduction
UC Irvine Machine Learning repository published an interesting data set about blog feedback. The data set originates from blog posts, and contains 230 features containing the length, total number of comments before basetime, 200 bags of words, and weekday information about the blog post. There are 51,878 rows of training data. And the goal is to predict the number of comments a given blog post will receive within the next 24 hours from the base time. There are 60 data sets containing 8,143 rows for testing. It is a good topic to apply regression, correlation and machine learning technique.
